;; This code uses Sawfish's synthesize-event function, which in turn uses
;; XSendEvent to pass the event to the window.  These synthetic events are
;; deliberately ignored by xterms and XEmacs, for security reasons.  To work
;; around this problem, start the terminal with

;; xterm -xrm 'xterm*allowSendEvents: True'

;; The analogous hack for XEmacs (not needed if you set
;; *keyboard-paste-use-gnuclient*) is to use

;; (setq x-allow-sendevents t)

;; These hacks open a fairly serious security hole, though, so only do this if
;; you know what you are doing.

;; If you have gnuclient available with your XEmacs installation, this module
;; can use that instead.  Just make sure that *keyboard-paste-use-gnuclient* is
;; set and there should be no need to allow send-events to XEmacs.


;; aterm honours XSendEvent as long as the mouse is over the terminal window,
;; which means that keyboard-paste works in that situation.


;; In order to fix this properly, Sawfish will need to be patched to use
;; XTestFakeKeyEvent in the XTest extension rather than XSendEvent, as suggested
;; at <http://www.handhelds.org:8080/wiki/GeneratingSyntheticEvents> (or possibly
;; by other means, such as using the XInputExtension; I don't know a great deal
;; about this area).
